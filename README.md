### How to play

Use the left and right arrow keys to move the tank left and right. Avoid being shot by the aliens. Use the space bar to shoot at the aliens. Each level will get harder until you die. Try to beat your high score!

### Features

* **Levels of increasing difficulty:** In each level the aliens get faster, their bullets get faster and they
shoot more.
* **Audio:** Be inspired by Bill Pullman's speech from Independence Day while you fight the alien forces.
* **Moving Aliens:** Look at how the aliens move their tentacles as they shoot at you. Isn't that cute? NO! It's deadly.

As a former mathematician, I believe there is beauty in algorithms and code. I’m looking for a position that will utilize my current skills in planning, coding and testing in order to develop state-of-the-art software solutions. I’d like to become part of an organization that provides an atmosphere of mutual growth and benefits, where I can showcase my talent and potential. I am organized, enjoy working with people, and have an aptitude for learning quickly. I enjoy challenges and look forward to the opportunity offered by my next team.

I am interested in agile development and being part of a team that is more interested in developing cutting edge technology than any specific language or framework. I have an interest in pursuing employment in FinTech or Health Care and have a passion for exploring bitcoin and block chain technology.
